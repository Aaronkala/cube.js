Let’s get started with the Сube.js framework. In this guide, we’ll learn step by step how to build a React Material UI dashboard. Unfortunately, most ready-made templates are static and work with pre-prepared data. To get data from the database usually needs to write a lot of code.

[Cube.js](https://cube.dev/) solve this problem, at the same time solving such issues as [analytic SQL generation](https://cube.dev/docs/cubejs-introduction), query results [caching](https://cube.dev/docs/frontend-introduction) and execution orchestration, [data pre-aggregation](https://cube.dev/docs/pre-aggregations), [security](https://cube.dev/docs/security), [API for query results fetch](https://cube.dev/docs/rest-api), and visualization.
Also, we will use [material-UI](https://material-ui.com/). This library gives React components for faster and easier web development.

Together these tools are perfectly combined. You can check out the [final application we are going to build here](https://material-u-i-dashboard.cubecloudapp.dev/).
